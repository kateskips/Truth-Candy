       <h2>Press Release</h2>
       <p>New York, NY - March 27, 2017: Truth Candy is a group exhibition brought to you by the New Media Arts Capstone students of Spring 2017. The artist curators are Roxanne Branford, Adrielle Cabahug, Kalin Chu Wong, Max Cohen, Emily Fariello, Kate Follett, Estefany Gonzaga, Jaime Huang, Chase Kaye, Roksolana Kotskovych, Enoch Sup Lee, Jayden Lei, Jia Li Lin, Lorenz Lina, Joeleen Moy, Aliza Naqvi, Seungho Yang, and Irene Zhang brought their art to life through video, animation, and 3D renderings of images. Truth Candy represents the assortment of truths each artist believes in—sometimes reflective, most times personal—exposing sometimes bitter truths, and making them palatable through art. Truth Candy is a four-fold journey starting with a society’s external confrontations and culminating in its internal struggles. Each artwork bares either sweetness or bitterness that represents distinct experiences of reality. Have some truth candy!</p>
 
<p>The second floor is titled “Americans.” Aliza Naqvi’s Labels, Chase Kaye’s We the People…,Kalin Chu Wong’s What Now?, Joeleen Moy’s Surface Tension, and Max Cohen’s Remember the Future?  dedicated their truths about life in the United States - past, present, and future. We the People… by Kaye, criticizes media and pop culture by juxtaposing it with personal video recordings and pop music; and Remember the Future? by Cohen, reminds us that if we as a society don’t keep up with the times, we are doomed to fall behind.</p>
 
<p>The third Floor, “Recognition,” showcases Adrielle Cabahug’s Cheese in NYC, Enoch Sup Lee’s Exposure Diagnosis, Estefany Marlen Gonzaga’s My Mom Has A Book Bag and Lorenz Lina’s Postponed Dance, all who aspire to gain the acknowledgement of their everyday routine and the struggle that accompanies it. Lee’s Exposure Diagnosis reveals the belittlement thriving artists have to face when dealing with businesses who want to utilize their talents. Gonzaga’s My Mom Has A Book Bag gives a unique perspective on the life of single moms.</p>
 
<p>The fourth floor, “Surroundings,” showcases Seungho Yang’s Serendipity, Jamie Huang’s Daily Dissatisfaction, Jia Li Lin’s The Light with Seasons, and Jia Jing Lei’s Expression of Feelings from Architecture, whose work revolves around the passing New York environment of four individuals who balance life and school. Yang’s Serendipity frames the beauty of nature, in an ever-changing city environment, to capture the disconnect between idealistic circumstances and the dull everyday. Jamie’s Daily Dissatisfaction reveals disappointment in everyday activities, from miscommunication to the weather.</p>
 
<p>The fifth floor is titled “Perceptions.” Emily Fariello’s Who Are You Now?, Irene Zhang’s Dark Vision, Roksolana Kotskovych’s That’s How I See Me, Kate Follett’s Beyond the Emotions of the Beholder and Roxanne Branford’s Inter-Rational focus on showcasing a mix array of artwork that follows through a fine split of one’s innermost fears and challenges that have to be countered by the society or the people around them. Branford explores the concept of self-discovery and growth as an international student, while uncovering her utmost fears of adjusting to the life around her. Fariello’s work explores the truth that people choose different personas in different societal scenarios on a daily basis to adapt to their surrounding.</p>
